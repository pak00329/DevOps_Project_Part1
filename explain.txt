db_connector file
I have renamed the queries to access columns "user_id" and "user_name" as these are the columns that work in my database.

retrieveUser()
Line 30 is trying to access ["user_name"] but the return from the function is ["userName"]

deleteUser()
Line 43 is trying to access ["user_name"] but the return from the function is ["userName"]

updateUser()
Line 37 is trying to access ["user_name"] but the return from the function is ["userName"]

marktest.py will run all four rest methods successfully. You can amend your backend test file to use this syntax.
